## What we've been working on

Over the past month, we've made a ton of improvements to Parsertime and the underlying infrastructure. You can 
read our full blog post [here](/blog/05-14-patch-notes) to see a detailed list of the changes we've made, but here's a quick summary:
- **We switched email providers** for higher uptime and reliability
- **We improved error messages** for an easier time understanding what happened when things go wrong
- **We improved core features** such as the killfeed table, the overview table, and scrim editing features
- **We added a privacy policy** that details what data we collect and why it's essential. Don't worry, we're 
not selling your data! You can see for yourself [here](https://parsertime.app/privacy) (and our code is open source!)
- And **so much more**! We're making gradual improvements platform-wide and making sure that everything gets 
the polish it deserves.

We've got so much more coming that we'll be working diligently to bring out to everyone as soon as possible. 

## What's next?

Our journey doesn't end here. We're expanding lux.dev as a whole and bringing on a whole host of new talent to 
increase our ability to ship changes fast and bring out new features that complement your coaching solutions. 
We're also starting a research team led by [Xavier](https://github.com/xavier-park) to continue our forays into 
machine learning solutions and artificial intelligence integrations. 

We're also in talks with a few teams for partnership opportunities - if you're interested, reach out to me on 
our [Discord](https://parserti.me/discord) or at [lucas@lux.dev](mailto:lucas@lux.dev) to get in touch! We'd 
be happy to work with you on custom feature requests, organization level support, onboarding, and so much more.

The future is bright and we're excited for everything that comes next! We'll be posting updates here and on 
our new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luxdotdev). Give us a follow and keep up to date with our latest developments!

## Thank you (yes, you!)

The community's support has made this project so impactful and exciting to work on. It's been incredible 
to see just how many stats have been uploaded (there's been over 90,000 kills!) and we can't wait to see that 
number grow as more people discover the benefits of using Parsertime. I personally can't wait to see what that 
number will look like after a year! ðŸ¥³

## Conclusion

Thank you for being a part of our journey so far. We're excited to see what the future holds and we're
looking forward to sharing it with you. If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat,
please join our [Discord](https://parserti.me/discord) and say hi! We're always happy to chat and
help out where we can.

Here's to many more months of Parsertime! ðŸ¥‚

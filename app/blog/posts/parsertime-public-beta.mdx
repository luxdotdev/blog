Parsertime is a tool aimed at helping Overwatch coaches and players understand
their statistics and trends in a more detailed way. We provide a variety of
features to help you analyze your gameplay and improve your performance.
Using our platform, you can visualize your scrim data, track individual
player performance, and more. Additionally, you can invite your players to
your team and allow them to see their stats.

### Why Parsertime?

Parsertime was built by coaches, for coaches. We understand the challenges
of analyzing gameplay data and wanted to create a platform that simplifies
the process. Our goal is to help you understand your team's performance
better and make data-driven decisions to improve your gameplay. Additionally,
we wanted to create a platform that allows you to easily see trends over time
and make the necessary adjustments to your coaching strategy. We also offer
[documentation](https://docs.parsertime.app) to help you get started,
community support via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/svz3qhVDXM), and
[email](mailto:help@parsertime.app) support if you get stuck. We're here to 
help you succeed!

#### Use Case 01: Handling Trials

As a coach, trials can be a stressful time. You need to evaluate players
quickly and make decisions about who to keep on your team. With Parsertime,
you can easily track player performance during trials and see how they
compare statistically. This can help you make more informed decisions about
which players to keep and which to let go.

#### Use Case 02: Tracking Improvement

Since Overwatch does not keep replays once a patch is released, it can be
difficult to track player improvement over time. With Parsertime, you can
easily track player performance week over week and see how they are improving.
The data you collect is persistent and can be used to help players understand
their strengths and weaknesses.

#### Use Case 03: Discovering Trends and Patterns

Understanding trends and patterns in your team's performance is crucial to
improving your gameplay. With Parsertime, you can easily visualize your team's
stats and see where you need to focus your coaching efforts. By identifying
areas of improvement, you can make data-driven decisions to help your team
succeed.
